# zbx-template-rx2530
IPMI Template for RX2530 Server

Tested with Zabbix 3.0

Just import the Template and you'll get a lot of items (mostly all available).
Not many triggers and graphs, customize to your own needs :)

For the IPMI stuff, login via the iRMC and create a User with PW. IMPI is enabled per default.
Within Zabbix IMPI configuration choose MD5.

Have fun! :)
